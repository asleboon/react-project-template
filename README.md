## React Spring Animations

A small project testing out the `react-spring` library.

The project uses the `useSpring` `useTransition` hooks and the `animated` component to create the animations.

Check out the library here [react-spring](https://www.react-spring)

Demo of the project can be viewed [here](react-spring-animations.now.sh)
